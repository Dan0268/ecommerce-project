#Ecommerce site

by Danijel Boskovic

An ecommerce site based on my old T-shirt website built in React and using Firebase backend. A dense learning exercise and a bit of a work in progress still, as passing information between components was hard to understand at times. Possible refactor using MySQL and Express or Spring on the way.

Known bugs:
* Problems passing things back to Firebase
* Refresh issues
